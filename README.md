# Matplotlib Challenge

In this challenge, I took the role of a Data Analyst for a pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA. I analyzed the dataset of their most recent animal study. The goal of the analysis was to draw conclusions as to which pharaceutical drug, if any, had an impact on reducing the size of tumor volume. 

## Getting Started 

As is the norm for many of these challenges, I am running this code out of my anaconda environment with Jupyter Notebook. For running this code on your machine, you will need a source-code editor with the proper dependencies installed.

### Analysis and Coding 

During this project, my coding really started to improve as I used multiple functions at a time and munged the data in order to display the values in a comprehensive manner. I used Matplotlib to create graphs throughout the challenge that displayed the data in a much more readable format. Utilizing tools for accurate data visualization is one of the most important aspects of a Data Analyst's job duties. This project was helpful in exploring and mastering tools used in visualization.

### Challenges or Additional Opportunities

The toughest part of this challenge was the very last visualization. Adjusting my syntax, calling the previous functions correctly, as well as mapping the tick funcitons were a little more complex than previous graphs.
